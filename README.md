## Self-Assessment

- We think this project helped us understand in a deeper way the integrating parts that build up a compiler for a high-level language. Therefore, it was very valuable to go through every part of implementing and completing said project. In spite of the difficulties we had to overcome, we think the work carried out throughout the semester was good and satisfactory, thus we think the project deserves a 16 out of 20.
